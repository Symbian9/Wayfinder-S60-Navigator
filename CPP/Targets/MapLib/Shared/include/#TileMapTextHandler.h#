/**
 
  THINGS LEFT TO DO:
 
In the cost function.
   test if the string is outside the screencords and set increase the cost
   for every char thats outside.
   test more possibel placments of the text. for example iterate al
   possible variations over every segment. now we only try by filling
   al but the last segment, could try by filling the first to the max.
   then to max - 1, then to max - 2, and so on.

In the place inside polygon.
   merge polygons from sorounding tilemaps so that we can put the text 
   of for example parks in the middle of the park and not in the middle
   of the tilemaps that lies in the park.

In getTextWidth.
   Change this methods implemetation to use a getwidth in maprenderer 
   and not the .width from the rectangle returned by getRectangle.
   this is ofcource slow as a snail and needs fixing.
