# This is the loglevels file, used to set the debuglevels of individual 
# debug prefixes.
#
# All lines with the very fist character set to '#' are comments.
#
# Each line must follow this syntax: 
#           <prefix> [ ERROR | WARNING | INFO | NONE | ALL ]*
# The order of the levels specifier doesn't matter.
# If a log object with a matching prefix is created, its debuglevels are
# set according to those specified. 
#
# Ex:
#   Example DEBUG WARNING
# Will let any Log object with prefix "Example" print DEBUG and WARNING
# level messages, but not ERROR or INFO level messages.
#
# Note: NONE always overrides any other level specification.
